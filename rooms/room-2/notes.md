the blue team focuses on cybersecurity, finding intrusions before they occur, and getting rid of them when/if they happen undetected.
# Room 2 notes
SOC , security operations centre is a team of cyber security professionals that monitors the network and its systems to detect malicious cyber security events. Some of the main areas of interest for a SOC are
Trends & Vulnerability Awareness

Keeping up to date with the latest trends and vulnerabilities in the industry is an essential skill to help understand the risks an organisation faces.
Policy Violations

A security policy is a set of rules that outline how an organisation's assets are to be used and protected. The SOC team monitors for adherence to these policies.
Unauthorised & Illegal Activity

The SOC team establishes a baseline of acceptable behaviour and activity. Any deviation from this baseline is investigated. Illegal activity exposes the organisation to higher risk.
Intrusion & Breach Detection

No matter how well protected an organisation is, there is always a risk of a breach. The SOC team is responsible for detecting and responding to these breaches.

Digital forensics is the application of traditional forensic science processes to digital devices. Digital forensics is used to preserve and analyse digital evidence to aide in the investigation of incidents, such as a breach. 
File System

Analysing a low-level copy of a system's storage reveals much information, such as installed programs, created, partially overwritten and deleted files.
System Memory

If an attacker runs a malicious program within the memory without saving it to the disk, the memory can be analysed to uncover details about how the program operates.
System Logs

Log files provide plenty of information about what happened on a system. Even if the attacker tries to clear their traces, some traces will remain.
Network Logs

Logs of the network traffic that have traversed a network would help answer more questions about whether an attack is occurring and what it entails.

Incident Response consists of  
Prep Creating the necessary resources and frameworks to handle an incident. This includes creating incident response teams, infrastructure to support in the incident response process, as well anything to help prevent the incidents, such as providing phishing awareness training.

Detection and analasys Using tooling and processes to detect incidents and assess their scope (reach) and severity. Logs can be analysed for suspicious events.

Containment, Eradication, and Recovery Limiting the impact of the incident, such as preventing a virus from spreading and eliminate the cause and restore affected systems.

Post incident activity Review the incident overall, how it was handled and could've been prevented. What were the learning points throughout the process? Do we need to provide further cyber awareness training?
